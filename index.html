            "Lions are the most social of all big cats and live in groups called prides. A pride consists of multiple related females, their cubs, and a few males.",
            "Lions have a powerful roar that can be heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away. This roar is used to communicate their presence and ward off intruders.",
            "Male lions are famous for their majestic manes, which signify maturity and health. The darker and fuller the mane, the more attractive the male is to lionesses.",
            "Although lionesses are primarily responsible for hunting, males will occasionally join in, especially when hunting larger prey like buffalo.",
            "Lionesses in a pride often synchronize their breeding, resulting in several cubs being born around the same time. This allows the cubs to nurse communally.",
            "Despite being referred to as the 'King of the Jungle,' lions actually live in grasslands and plains. The term likely arose from their regal appearance and behavior.",
            "Lions are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.",
            "Lions have excellent night vision, which is six times better than that of humans. This helps them during nighttime hunting.",
            "Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) in short bursts, which is crucial for catching fast-moving prey.",
            "Lions are known for their laziness, sleeping and resting for about 16 to 20 hours a day. This conserves energy for hunting and territorial defense."
